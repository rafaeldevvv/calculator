## About Project

If you look at the code, you'll realize that instead of just replacing characters and passing a javascript math expression string to `Function` or `eval`, i chose to parse the expression because I wanted a real challenge.

I thought that because I have already made more complex projects, a calculator would be too easy and it really was even increasing the difficulty by with actual parsing.

It was a fun project. I could have finished it quicker, but I spent some time reading some interesting articles about some javascript concepts.
